{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Fine-Tuning T5 Model for English-to-Tigrinya Translation\n","\n","This script fine-tunes the `t5-large` model for English-to-Tigrinya translation. The process involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using the BLEU metric. Below is a summary of the workflow and observations.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Key Steps\n","\n","### 1. **Model and Tokenizer Initialization**\n","- The pre-trained `t5-large` model and tokenizer are loaded from the Hugging Face library.\n","- The tokenizer is configured to handle English as the source language and Tigrinya as the target language.\n","\n","### 2. **Data Preprocessing**\n","- Training and validation datasets are tokenized with padding and truncation to a maximum sequence length of 128 tokens.\n","- Labels are generated for the target language using the tokenizer.\n","\n","### 3. **Training Process**\n","- The model is fine-tuned for 3 epochs using the Hugging Face `Trainer` class with:\n","  - Learning rate: `3e-5`\n","  - Batch size: 8\n","  - Weight decay: 0.01\n","- Dynamic padding is implemented via a `DataCollatorForSeq2Seq`.\n","\n","### 4. **Evaluation**\n","- Translations are generated for the validation set using the fine-tuned model.\n","- BLEU scores are calculated to evaluate translation quality.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Observations\n","\n","### Baseline BLEU Score\n","- The baseline BLEU score after fine-tuning is **0.0028**, indicating very poor translation quality.\n","\n","### Challenges with the T5 Model\n","1. **Low BLEU Score**:\n","   - Despite fine-tuning, the BLEU score is extremely low, suggesting that the model struggles to generate accurate translations for the English-to-Tigrinya task.\n","   - This reflects the model's inability to effectively learn patterns between the two languages.\n","\n","2. **Inadequate Pre-training for Tigrinya**:\n","   - The `t5-large` model is not specifically pre-trained on Tigrinya, a low-resource language, limiting its capacity to understand and translate to/from Tigrinya.\n","\n","3. **Metric Limitations**:\n","   - The BLEU score may fail to fully capture the quality of translations for morphologically rich languages like Tigrinya.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","\n","The fine-tuned T5 model is not effective for English-to-Tigrinya translation. The BLEU score remains negligible even after fine-tuning, highlighting the following limitations:\n","- Lack of sufficient pre-training on Tigrinya data.\n","- Challenges posed by the complexity and morphology of the Tigrinya language.\n","\n","### Recommendations\n","- Use a model pre-trained or fine-tuned on multilingual datasets that include Tigrinya.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"nNPeiQgKsVsY"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":17455,"status":"ok","timestamp":1733696347506,"user":{"displayName":"Rahwa
